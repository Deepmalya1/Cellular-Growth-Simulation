# Cellular-Growth-Simulation-Using-Cellular-Automata
 This project simulates Brain, Liver, and Body cells, focusing on cell lifespan, reproduction, and behavior in the presence of disease, using Cellular Automata Theory. I developed both a web-based and a Python version, making it an engaging and insightful project.
