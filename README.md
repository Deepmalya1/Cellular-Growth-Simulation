# Cellular-Growth-Simulation-Using-Cellular-Automata
 This project simulates Brain, Liver, and Body cells, focusing on cell lifespan, reproduction, and behavior in the presence of disease, using Cellular Automata Theory. I developed both a web-based and a Python version, making it an engaging and insightful project.

# Cell Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the behaviour of Brain, Liver, and Body cells, focusing on their lifespan, reproduction, and interactions with diseases. Using Cellular Automata Theory, it provides an interactive way to observe how different types of cells act in various conditions. The simulation is available in both a web-based version and a Python version.

## Features

- **Cell Types**: Simulates Brain, Liver, Normal Body, and Disease cells.
- **Lifespan and Reproduction**: Each cell type has a unique lifespan and reproduction rate.
- **Disease Interaction**: Watch how cells react to varying disease strengths.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualize cell growth and decay over time.
- **User Controls**: Add cells, adjust disease strength, and control the simulation speed.

## Technologies Used

- **Web Version**: JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS
- **Python Version**: Python, Pygame (or other relevant libraries)

- ###FOR PYTHON
- pip install pygame
- Then Run the code
